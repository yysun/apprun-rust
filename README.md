## AppRun Rust Demo

This is an [AppRun](https://github.com/yysun/apprun) app template for developing WebAssembly using Rust.

> You need the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) tool chain, and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) installed first.

* Use _npm start_ to start the dev server
* Use _npm run build_ to build for production

Have fun.
